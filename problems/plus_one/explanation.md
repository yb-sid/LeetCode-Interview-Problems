# Plus One Problem

## Overview
The "Plus One" problem is a coding problem that focuses on adding one to a given integer represented as an array of digits. This problem is often encountered when working with large numbers or numerical operations in programming.

## Problem Statement
Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment the integer by one and return the result as an array. The digits are stored in reverse order, meaning that the 1's digit is at the first position of the array.

## Example
### Input
Array of Digits: [1, 2, 3]

### Output
Result Array: [1, 2, 4]

### Explanation
The input array represents the integer 321. When we add one to it, we get 322, which is represented as [1, 2, 4] in reverse order.

## Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm that simulates the addition of one to the given number:
1. Start from the rightmost digit (the 1's place).
2. Add one to that digit.
3. If the result is less than 10 (i.e., it's a single-digit number), we can stop and return the updated array.
4. If the result is 10, set that digit to 0 and carry over 1 to the next digit.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the next digit, and so on, until there are no more digits left.
