# Inorder Traversal in a Binary Tree

## Overview
Inorder traversal is a depth-first tree traversal technique used to visit nodes in a binary tree. In this traversal, nodes are visited in the following order: left subtree, current node, and then right subtree. In other words, you start at the root of the tree and recursively visit the left subtree, process the current node, and then visit the right subtree.

## Approach (Recursive)
To perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree recursively, you can use the following algorithm:

1. If the current node is null (empty), return.
2. Recursively perform an inorder traversal on the left subtree.
3. Process (e.g., print or store) the current node's value.
4. Recursively perform an inorder traversal on the right subtree.
