# Reverse Linked List Using Stack

## Overview
The "Reverse Linked List Using Stack" is an approach that involves using a stack data structure to reverse the order of nodes in a linked list. This method provides an alternative way to achieve the reversal compared to the traditional iterative or recursive methods.

## Approach
To reverse a linked list using a stack, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Traverse the original linked list.
3. For each node, push it onto the stack.
4. After traversing the entire list, the stack will contain the nodes in reverse order.
5. Pop nodes from the stack to reconstruct the reversed linked list.
