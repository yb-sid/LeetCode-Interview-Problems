# Excel Sheet Column Number Problem

## Overview
The Excel Sheet Column Number problem is a common coding problem that focuses on converting a column title represented as a string into its corresponding column number in an Excel spreadsheet. In Excel, columns are labeled with uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', and then 'AA', 'AB', and so on.

## Problem Statement
Given a string representing a column title in an Excel spreadsheet, return its corresponding column number. The column title is composed of uppercase English letters.

## Example
### Input
Column Title: "AB"

### Output
Column Number: 28

### Explanation
In Excel, "A" represents 1, "B" represents 2, and so on. Therefore, "AB" represents 1 * 26^1 + 2 * 26^0 = 28.

## Approach
To convert an Excel column title to its corresponding column number, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable, `result`, to 0 to accumulate the column number.
2. Iterate through each character in the column title from right to left.
3. For each character, convert it to its corresponding numeric value (e.g., 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2, ..., 'Z' -> 26).
4. Multiply the numeric value by the appropriate power of 26 based on its position (rightmost character is 26^0, next is 26^1, and so on).
5. Add the result to the accumulated `result`.
6. Continue this process for each character in the column title.
7. The final `result` is the column number.
