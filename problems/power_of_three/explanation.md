# Power of Three Using Logarithms

## Overview
The Power of Three Using Logarithms approach is a method to check if a given integer is a power of three by utilizing the property that the logarithm of a power of three to the base three is an integer.

## Approach
To check if an integer `n` is a power of three using logarithms, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the logarithm of `n` to the base three using a logarithmic function (e.g., the natural logarithm `ln`).
2. If the result of the logarithm is a whole number (an integer), then `n` is a power of three.

**Note** : Take care of minor difference in floating point values
