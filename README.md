## Problem Subfolder Structure

Each problem subfolder , inside /problems contains the following:

- `readme.md`: This file provides an overview of the problem, its description, and the approach used to solve it.
- `problem_name.py`: Python solution for the problem.
- `ProblemName.java`: Java solution for the problem.
- `Problem_name.go`: Go solution for the problem (planned).
- `ProblemName.scala`: Scala solution for the problem (planned).

## Problem Overview

For each problem, refer to the `readme.md` file in the respective problem subfolder. It provides detailed information about the problem statement and the logic employed to solve it.

## Language Support

- Python
- Java
- Go (planned)
- Scala (planned)

Remember that understanding the concepts behind each solution is crucial. These solutions are provided for learning purposes, so take the time to study the algorithms and approaches used.

We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for your interview preparation. Happy coding and best of luck with your interviews!

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided in this repository are meant to serve as learning resources. It's important to understand the concepts and algorithms behind each solution rather than simply memorizing or copying code.
